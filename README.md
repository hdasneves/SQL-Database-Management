# SQL-Database-Management

This repository represents an application in which you can import a Database and then modify, add and delete rows. The Database contains informations about the composition of a portofolio and should have as columns : the ticker, the type of asset (Actions, Obligations, ETF and Cash) and the amount owned. If the Database contains rows, a PieChart showing the portfolio breakdown by asset type appears.
